# Signals-Processing
Developed by: Sahir Vellani and Manfred Cheung
## Convolution
Returns a plot of the Convolution sum of 2 matlab vectors `input1` and `input2`.
Sampling frequency `f` is also required.
## Fourier Series
Returns the Fourier coefficient `k` of a matlab vector `x` given the range of frequencies `w0` (also a matlab vector).
## Fourier Transform
Returns a plot of the Discrete Time Fourier transform (DTFT) of a matlab vector `x0` given its time domain `t0` and the output frequency domain `w0`
*Note: The output contains only the magnitude "abs" of the DTFT*
### Inverse Fourier Transform
Returns a plot of the original function given its DTFT. Requires DTFT (`xw0`), as well as frequency domain and time domain 

# DTMF 
Returns a phone number corresponding to the sequences of dial tone frequencies. 

Input file format is *.mat*
Sampling rate (Hz) is also required.
